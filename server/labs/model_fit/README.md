# MODSIR-19 LABS model_fit Module File

The labs directory (and consequently Python module) contains a series of scripts 
allowing to conveniently interact with the simulator.py code. 

The model_fit module allows 
to adjust the parameters of a model to fit over actual measured data points.

## Scripts

```
python3 -m labs.model_fit.script
```

* `optimise.py`: ... to be done ... please run with `--help` argumen to have a short description.
